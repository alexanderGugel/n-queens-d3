n-queens problem visualized
===========================

__WIP__

This project aims to visualize various algorithms for the [n-queens problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) by rendering a decision tree. The goal of each algorithm is to place n queens on a n×n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
